# Extensible-Visual-Composer-Siddhi-Language-
WSO2 Complex Event Processor is a relatime analytics engine that support SQL like queries. Idea of the project is to build a visual composer for Siddhi language that provides a palette of operators and let users drag and drop those operators to a canvas and visually compose queries. We will provide a JSON description of operators, and the project involve developing a palette initialised with those operators and develop the canvas for visually composing queries.
